                Product manager, electrical engineer, programmer, avid hiker. All of these terms describe me at one point or another, but what ties them together is my love for challenges and desire to always be learning. I'd been telling myself for years I'd set up a site to log various projects and proofs, and as an added bonus it's been a great way to learn html and web development!
