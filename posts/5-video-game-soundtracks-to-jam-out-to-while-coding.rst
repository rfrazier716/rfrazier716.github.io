Doom (2016) - Mick Gordon
==========================
Depending on the task I gravitate towards different music genres. If I'm deriving a proof or algorithm, I listen to calm, instrumental music. Sketching ideas or brainstorming though, and I put on upbeat tunes. Then there's times when, eyes bloodshot and energy drink in hand, I'm blazing through code like a wannabe hacker channeling my inner `Cereal`_. This is where Doom Comes in!

Filed under *Progressive Metal*, Mick Gordon's TGA winning soundtrack is full of high energy tracks to get your blood pumping. While a few songs feature samples of the 1993 classic (I'm looking at you "At DOOM's Gate"), Most tracks set themselves apart from the original game's already great songs. If you want to make an evening of debug feel like you're pulling off a Shadowrun heist, look no further than Doom.

A Hat in Time - Pascal Michael Stiefel
=======================================
If you need to dedicate a long period of time to focus, look not further than the soundtrack to *A Hat In Time*. Clocking in at over 5 hours, this is the perfect soundtrack to put on when you want a constant stream of background music without jumping between albums.

Originally released in 2017, this is the only game on the list that I hadn't played before hearing the soundtrack. But after listening to it through multiple times I've picked it up to see just what crazy world all these upbeat tracks exist in.  Standout songs are `Train Rush`_ and `Trainwreck of Electro Swing`_ but you really can't to wrong with any of the tracks that vary from slow and atmospheric, to upbeat and jazzy. Best of all, each song is full length and fleshed out, instead of being a collection of looping sound bytes.

Desktop Dungeons - Danny Baronowsky & Grant Kirkhope
=====================================================
There's a solid chance you haven't heard of Desktop Dungeons, a smaller indie game from 2013. However, you've probably heard of Ubisoft's X-Com/Mushroom Kingdom Crossover "Mario + Rabbids, Kingdom Battle" (music by Kirkhope) or the indie hit turned Legend of Zelda spinoff "Crypt of the Necrodancer" (music by Baronowsky). With two great composers behind it, it's no wonder the Desktop Dungeons soundtrack turned out as good as it did.

Mostly Orchestral with some great Brassy sections, these tracks are perfect to put on when you need a bit of energy but don't want something so intense that it distracts your focus. The game itself is well worth attention too. A "coffee-break" turn-based dungeon crawler, rounds are done in 15 minutes or less and incredibly satisfying. I spent countless lunch breaks playing through the alpha in college. Which is still available for free of the Developer's Website.
