Need a great set of songs to play while problem solving? Put on a video game soundtrack! The lack of lyrics stop them from being a distraction, but they're engaging enough to help you focus and drown out background noise. Below are five soundtracks I regularly reach for whenever I'm trying to program and need to shut out the world.

Doom (2016) - Mick Gordon
==========================
Depending on the task,  I gravitate towards different music genres. Deriving proofs or algorithms calls for calm, instrumental music, whereas sketching ideas or brainstorming is best with upbeat, poppy tunes. Then there's times when, eyes bloodshot and energy drink in hand, I'm blazing through code like a wannabe hacker channeling my inner `Cereal`_. This is where Doom Comes in!

Filed under *Progressive Metal*, Mick Gordon's TGA winning soundtrack is full of high energy tracks to get your blood pumping. While a few songs feature samples of the 1993 classic (I'm looking at you "At DOOM's Gate"), Most tracks set themselves apart from the original game's already great songs. If you want to make an evening of debug feel like you're pulling off a Shadowrun heist, look no further than Doom.

Celeste - Lena Raine
=====================
A game that needs no introduction, Celeste is an incredibly popular platformer that still manages to regularly show up on "hidden indie gems" lists. When an entire subcomponent of the game is to collect floating casette tapes to unlock "B-Side" levels, you know music must play a big role, and Lena Raine does not disappoint!

The only negative of this soundtrack is how short it is, as I find myself regularly looping through the 100 minutes of tracks only to be disappointed when it ends. The feel of the songs range from motivating and energetic, to downright haunting, but every one is a perfect accompaniment when focusing on a task. 


Desktop Dungeons - Danny Baronowsky & Grant Kirkhope
=====================================================
There's a solid chance you haven't heard of Desktop Dungeons, a smaller indie game from 2013. However, you've probably heard of Ubisoft's X-Com/Mushroom Kingdom Crossover `Mario + Rabbids, Kingdom Battle`_ (music by Kirkhope) or the indie hit turned Legend of Zelda spinoff `Crypt of the Necrodancer`_ (music by Baronowsky). With two great composers behind it, it's no wonder the Desktop Dungeons soundtrack turned out as good as it did.

Mostly Orchestral with some great brass sections, these tracks are perfect to put on when you need a bit of energy but don't want something so intense that it distracts your focus. The game itself is well worth attention too. A "coffee-break" turn-based dungeon crawler, rounds are done in 15 minutes or less and incredibly satisfying. The alpha is still available for free on the `Developer's Website`_.

Payday 2 - Simon Viklund
=========================
Similar to Doom, Payday 2's Soundtrack is full of blood pumping tracks to keep you amped while you fly through for loops (or robbing a bank, you do you). Unlike Doom's metal approach, however, Payday's songs are more suited for an early 2000's rave, with lots of industrial sound effects and synthesizers.

Only recently going up on `Spotify`_, these tracks are the creations of Simon Viklund, who has since left Overkill Software to make another well received Co-Op shooter, `GTFO`_. Supposedly Payday 3 is in the works for a 2023 release, but with both Viklund and original game designer Ulf Anderson out of the picture I'm hard pressed to believe it will capture the charm of the originals.

A Hat in Time - Pascal Michael Stiefel
=======================================
If you need to dedicate a long period of time to focus, look not further than the soundtrack to A Hat In Time. Clocking in at over 5 hours, this is the perfect soundtrack to put on when you want a constant stream of background music without jumping between albums.

Originally released in 2017, this is the only game on the list that I hadn't played before hearing the soundtrack. But after listening to it through multiple times I've picked it up to see just what crazy world all these upbeat tracks exist in.  Standout songs are `Train Rush`_ and `Trainwreck of Electro Swing`_ but you really can't to wrong with any of the tracks that vary from slow and atmospheric, to upbeat and jazzy. Best of all, each song is full length and fleshed out, instead of being a collection of looping sound bytes.
